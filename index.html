        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Social media has become an integral part of teenagers' lives, shaping their social interactions, self-perception, and emotional well-being. 
            While it offers opportunities for learning, networking, and self-expression, excessive use of social media can have profound psychological effects.

        <h2>Negative Effects of Social Media</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Anxiety and Depression</h3>
            <p>
                Research shows a strong link between heavy social media use and increased levels of anxiety and depression. Teenagers often compare 
                themselves to unrealistic portrayals of life, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Constant exposure to curated content 
                can create a distorted perception of reality.

            <h3>Sleep Disruption</h3>
            <p>
                Excessive social media use, especially before bedtime, interferes with sleep cycles. The blue light emitted from screens disrupts 
                melatonin production, making it harder for teenagers to fall asleep. Sleep deprivation is linked to cognitive issues, mood swings, and 
                reduced academic performance.

            <h3>Cyberbullying</h3>
            <p>
                Social media platforms have become hotspots for cyberbullying. Online harassment can lead to emotional distress, social withdrawal, 
                and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. Victims of cyberbullying often struggle with trust issues and self-worth.

        <h2>Scientific Studies on Social Media and Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
            Several studies highlight the negative effects of excessive social media use on mental health:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A study by the **University of Pennsylvania** found that reducing social media use to 30 minutes per day significantly decreased depression and loneliness among users.</li>
            <li>According to **Mayo Clinic**, teenagers who spend more than 3 hours daily on social media are at a greater risk of mental health problems.</li>
            <li>The **American Psychological Association** reports that excessive screen time leads to increased stress and anxiety levels.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>1. Set Screen Time Limits</h3>
            <p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            While social media has revolutionized communication, its impact on teenagers' mental health cannot be ignored. By implementing healthy digital habits,
